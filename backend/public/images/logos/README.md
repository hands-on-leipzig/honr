# Program, season, and role logos

Logo files in this directory are **committed to the repository** so they deploy with the app to test and production.

## Directory layout

- **programs/** – First program logos. Filename = `{program_id}.{ext}` (e.g. `1.jpg` for program ID 1). Contains `default.svg` when no custom logo is set.
- **seasons/** – Season logos. Filename = `{season_id}.{ext}` (e.g. `1.png` for season ID 1). Contains `default.svg` when no custom logo is set.
- **roles/** – Role icons (badges). Filename = `{role_id}.{ext}` (e.g. `1.svg`). Generated by `php artisan roles:generate-icons --generate-svgs` or uploaded via Admin.

## One-time: move existing icons from storage into the repo

If you previously had icons under `backend/public/storage/logos` (gitignored), copy them into this tree and run migrations:

```bash
# From repo root
bash scripts/move-logos-from-storage-to-repo.sh
cd backend && php artisan migrate --force
```

Then commit the new files under `backend/public/images/logos/`.

## Making logos available on test/production

1. **Add the image file** to the correct folder:
   - Program logo for program ID 1 → `programs/1.jpg` (or `.png`, `.svg`, `.webp`)
   - Season logo for season ID 1 → `seasons/1.jpg` (or other supported format)
2. **Commit and push** to your branch. The file will be included in the next deploy.
3. **Database**: Ensure `logo_path` points to the file (e.g. `images/logos/programs/1.jpg`). If you previously uploaded via Admin UI on that environment, the DB already has this; otherwise set it in Admin or via a one-off update.

**Important:** Logos uploaded only via the Admin UI on the server are stored on that server only. They are **not** in the repo and will be missing after a fresh deploy. To have a logo on test (and later production) after every deploy, add the file here and commit it to GitHub.

### Copying a logo from the test server into the repo

If you already uploaded a logo on test (e.g. program 1 → `1.jpg`) and want it to deploy with the app:

```bash
# From your machine, copy the file from the server (adjust host and path)
scp user@test.honr.hands-on-technology.org:/path/to/current/backend/public/images/logos/programs/1.jpg backend/public/images/logos/programs/

# Then commit and push
git add backend/public/images/logos/programs/1.jpg
git commit -m "Add program 1 logo for deploy"
git push
```

After the next deploy, the logo will be present on test (and can be deployed to production the same way).
